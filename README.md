# README

This is a redo on the Century Bakery app that I had started some time ago but had not really completed. Initially, I had a separate API backend and frontend but decided to use a Rails monolith instead. 

Just wanted to go back to the basics so to speak.


This will be a web app until I figure out how to create it on Android or iOS.
